# 🎯 PHP Design Patterns Study

A personal learning repository where I practice and implement various design patterns in PHP. This repository documents my journey of learning design patterns through practical, hands-on examples.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- My personal workspace for learning and understanding design patterns
- A collection of practical implementations that help me grasp pattern concepts
- A way to track my progress from simple to more complex implementations
- A reference for my future self and others who might be on a similar learning path

The examples are intentionally kept simple and self-contained, focusing on clear pattern implementation rather than real-world complexity. Each implementation represents my understanding and interpretation of the patterns as I learn them.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher (using enums and readonly classes)
- No external dependencies or frameworks needed
- Basic understanding of OOP concepts

## 📁 Project Structure

```
design-patterns/
├── 📂 Pattern1/
│   └── Implementation files
├── 📂 Pattern2/
│   └── Implementation files
└── 📝 README.md
```

Each pattern has its own directory containing multiple examples. I start with simple implementations and gradually move to more complex ones as I better understand the pattern.

### 📚 Code Organization

- Each example is self-contained in a single file for simplicity
- Files are named according to their main functionality
- Examples use modern PHP features (PHP 8.1+)
- Code follows PSR-12 coding standards

## 🚀 Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metinbolat/design-patterns.git
```

2. Navigate to a specific pattern's directory

```bash
cd design-patterns/Observer
```

3. Run any example using PHP CLI

```bash
php Newsletter.php
```

### 📝 Note

This is a learning repository - the implementations might not be perfect or production-ready, but they represent my learning process and understanding of design patterns.
